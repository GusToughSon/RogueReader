Key Components:
Memory Reading: You are using NomadMemory.au3 to read from specific memory addresses like Type, HP, MaxHP, and Pos X/Y, which are handled correctly using the base address and offsets.
GUI: The GUI includes all labels and controls for displaying relevant information, along with buttons for terminating the process and exiting the script.
Healer Logic: You have correctly implemented the logic to check if the HealerStatus is ON and compare HP2 with the healing threshold from the slider. It sends the "2" key if the conditions are met, followed by the defined sleep interval (pottimer).
Hotkey Handling: The use of backtick () to toggle HealerStatus` is working as expected with a sleep buffer to avoid rapid toggling.
Target Logic: The attack mode and target logic for sending {TAB} and waiting are also well implemented.
