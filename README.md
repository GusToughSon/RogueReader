## 🔧 WHAT THIS BABY DOES

Let’s pop the hood and see the goodies under there!

### 🚶‍♂️ WALKER MODE
- Records where you've been and auto-walks through your favorite monster-smashing spots.
- Supports forward **AND** reverse loops. That’s right, it moonwalks!

### ⚔️ AUTO-TARGET & ATTACK
- Spots the monsters like a hawk and hits ‘em like a runaway train.
- No target? No problem! *TAB* target cycling built right in.

### ❤️ AUTO-HEAL & CURE
- Heals when your health dips and cures your status problems.
- Supports “old school” pot hack style or delay-based smart healing.

### 👜 AUTOLLOOT SYSTEM
- Loots nearby tiles intelligently by checking game memory.
- Clicks those sweet drop piles so you don’t have to.

### 🤕 DEATH DETECTION
- Notices if your character suddenly teleports (aka *dies*) and shuts off helpers.
- No more running into walls while unconscious!

### 🧠 SMART MEMORY READER
- Reads game memory like it’s skimming a comic book.
- Keeps your GUI updated in real time with health, position, chat state, and more.
