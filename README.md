# RogueReader

**RogueReader** is a tool that reads memory values from a game called **Project Rogue Client** and helps you do some cool things, like setting waypoints for your character to move automatically and healing when needed.

## How It Works

- **Memory Reading:** The tool looks at the game's memory and finds important numbers, like your character's position and health.
- **Waypoints:** You can tell the tool to remember up to 20 places (called "waypoints") that your character should move to.
- **Auto-Healing:** The tool can automatically heal your character when their health gets low.
- **GUI:** The tool has a small window where you can see what's happening and interact with it.

- **Pos X**: Your character's current X position on the map.<br>

- **HP (Health Points)**: Your character's current health.<br>
- **Max HP**: The maximum health your character can have.<br>
- **Healer Status**: Tells you if the healer is on or off.<br>

## Auto-Healing

- The tool can automatically heal your character by pressing the `2` key when their health gets too low.
- You can set a threshold to control when the healing happens. By default, it will heal when your characterâ€™s health drops below **95%**.

## Troubleshooting

- **Exit Button Not Working**: If you click the exit button and nothing happens, donâ€™t worry! This has been fixed, and the exit button should now work properly.
- **Errors**: If you run into problems, make sure the game is open and the tool can read its memory.
