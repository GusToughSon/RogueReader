# 🚗✨ WELCOME TO ROGUE READER! ✨🚗
*(The magic button masher that does all the boring stuff for you!)*

---

## WHAT IS THIS?

Hey kiddo!  
You ever play a game where you have to heal, loot, cure sickness, and walk *all the way across the whole world*... over and over and over?

**BORING!!!** 😴

Well, GUESS WHAT?!  
**Rogue Reader** is like having your own *invisible robot buddy* who:
- Heals you when you get hurt! 🤕✨
- Cures you when you're sick! 🤢✨
- Smacks the bad guys when you forget! 👊👹✨
- Walks around all by itself to places you saved! 🚶‍♂️🏰✨
- And picks up all the shiny stuff! 💎🐿️✨

---

## HOW DOES IT WORK?

Just like buying a used car:
- **Step 1:** Push the "HEAL" button. (*vroom vroom! now you heal!*)
- **Step 2:** Push the "CURE" button. (*no more cough-cough!*)
- **Step 3:** Push the "TARGET" button. (*pew pew pew! find bad guys!*)
- **Step 4:** Push the "WALKER" button. (*off we goooo! to grandma's house!*)
- **Step 5:** Check the "AUTOLOOT" checkbox. (*scooping up treasure like a raccoon!*)

Then sit back, relax, and eat some candy. 🍬

The trainer will:
- **Auto-heal** you when you get hurt!
- **Auto-cure** you when you get a boo-boo!
- **Auto-target** bad guys when they show up!
- **Auto-walk** to all the cool places you saved!
- **Auto-loot** all the treasure when monsters fall down!

---

## WHAT IF I DIE??? 😵‍💫

**NO WORRIES, LITTLE BUDDY!**

If you *splat* and respawn somewhere far far away (more than 25 tiles away!),  
the trainer **stops everything** to keep you safe! 🛑🚫

It turns off:
- Healing
- Curing
- Targeting
- Walking

**No more ghost running around crazy!** 👻

---

## HOW DOES LOOTING WORK?

Oooh good question!

When you beat monsters, your robot buddy gets excited and clicks all over the shiny stuff!

**Loot rules:**
- 🥇 Beat 1–3 monsters → click the shiny stuff **4 times** each!
- 🥈 Beat 4–6 monsters → click the shiny stuff **6 times** each!
- 🥉 Beat 7–9 monsters → click the shiny stuff **8 times** each!
- 🏆 Beat 10+ monsters → click the shiny stuff **10 times** each!

**BUT!!**  
If you get super-duper greedy (more than **20 monsters**)?  
👮 *"WHOA there, cowboy!"*  
The robot buddy stops counting after 20. No more!
